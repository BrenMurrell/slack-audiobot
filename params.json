{"name":"Slack Audiobot","tagline":"Giving Slack some audio feedback capability","body":"Welcome!\r\n\r\n## What is Audiobot?\r\nAudiobot is an audio feedback bot for Slack.  Slack Audiobot is written in node.js and plays MP3 files from it's /sound directory based on queues from Slack users. Audiobot now also features text-to-speech (TTS) for Mac and Windows.\r\n\r\n## Why is Audiobot?\r\nAudio feedback seemed like a great way to liven up the office, but can also be used to provide realtime feedback around events in Slack.\r\n\r\n## How to Audiobot\r\n1. Grab the repo and run npm install. This will install all of the dependencies Audiobot requires.\r\n2. Add a bot integration in Slack [here](https://slack.com/services/new/bot)\r\n3. Add your bot's API key to config.js\r\n4. Run `node audiobot.js` from the command line\r\n5. Invite your brand new bot into the channels you'd like it to watch.\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\nHere's a couple commands you might like to try:\r\n* `play bell` - this will play the bell noise (comes with this package)\r\n* `@BOTNAME help` - get a list of commands you can use with your bot (replace BOTNAME with your bot's name, obviously)\r\n* `@BOTNAME list` - get a list of valid sound files. If you want more, just dump them in the sounds folder\r\n* `@BOTNAME stop` - stop the bot listening to requests for sounds\r\n* `@BOTNAME start` - start the bot listening to requests for sounds  (on by default)\r\n* `@BOTNAME say MESSAGE` - Make the bot speak via TTS.","google":"UA-70614206-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
